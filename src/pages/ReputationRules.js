        <h2>What is Reputation?</h2>
        <p>
          Reputation system is here to help you make a better decision when trading with others.
          It is a documentation of your trading history and experience with the person on the other side. <br/>

          More reputation will grant you higher reputation titles.<br/><br/>
          An even better representation of your reputation quality is your grade (1.0 - 5.0). <br/>
          Grade is calculated based on: <br/><br/>
          <ul style={{marginLeft: "30px"}}>
            <li>Who you received reputation from</li>
            <li>In what time you gained reputation</li>
            <li> Amount of positive reputation, relative to negative</li>
          </ul> <br/>
          <span style={{color: "yellow"}}>&#9888;</span> By no means does this mean we vouch or state you should trust someone, regardless of their 
          reputation, grade, titles, tags or status and arenâ€™t responsible for any potential scams. Full in depth prevent scam guide
